# ðŸ“Š Data Science Portfolio â€“ [Lourdes Landoni]

Welcome! I'm Lourdes Landoni, a Food Technologist and Researcher transitioning into Data Scientist. This portfolio showcases selected projects in Power BI, data analysis, and machine learning.

## ðŸ”¹ Projects Overview

| Project | Tools | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [ðŸ“ˆ FAO/WHO Nutritional Survey Results (Rosario-Argentina, 2013) ](https://github.com/lourdeslandoni/encuesta-nutri-fao-2013) | Power BI | This interactive Power BI dashboard presents results from the "First Study on the Nutritional Status and Eating Habits of the Adult Population in Rosario," conducted in Argentina in 2013 following FAO guidelines. The study surveyed 2,400 adults of various age groups, who reported everything they consumed the previous day.
